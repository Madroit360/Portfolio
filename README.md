This contains a few projects I completed as a Digital Marketer.

## Digital Marketing for an Education Consultant Firm 

### Problem Statement: The firm helps students to choose the right course for their education outside of India. The firm was only working on Word-of-mouth Marketing and now wanted to explore other avenues of marketing to recruit more students.

### Action Taken: 
1. I started with a basic check of online presence and then moved ahead with outlining of the new website.
2. To add brand value, I created a new Logo and finalized the brand colors.
3. I made a buyer persona and then created social media handles like FB, Insta, LinkedIn, and Youtube.
4. I did the required research to start generating content for social media pages.
5. I looked out for events and started representing the firm.

### Result:
1. The enquires increased by 20%
2. The website traction increased and hence helped in SEO.
